# Past Perfect Beta

This program is intended for archeologists and restorators to use to piece together a complete picture of fragments found in archeological sites without physically handling the fragile fragments themselves

This is a early version of part of my planned Master Thesis for the
spring semester of 2023 in the master's program Applied Computer
Science at NTNU Gj√∏vik. This program serves as my contribution to the
2022 course IMT4894 Advanced Project Work.
